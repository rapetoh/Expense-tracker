MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)1. Product VisionA "Zero-Friction" expense tracker for Gen Z and Millennials who find manual entry tedious. The app differentiates itself through high-fidelity aesthetics (Neumorphism or Glassmorphism) and an AI-first voice interface that feels like texting a friend.2. Core User PersonasThe Busy Professional: Needs to log coffee/commutes in seconds while walking.The Visual Budgeter: Needs beautiful, glanceable data that doesn't look like a boring spreadsheet.3. Key MVP Features (The "Must-Haves")A. The "Magic Button" (Voice UX)Instant Start: A prominent, central action button that triggers the mic on a long press.Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use an LLM (like GPT-4o-mini) to parse: "Spent twelve bucks on a salad at Sweetgreen" → Amount: $12.00, Vendor: Sweetgreen, Category: Food.Visual Confirmation: As the user speaks, text appears in real-time. Once finished, a small "Success" animation plays with a soft haptic "pop."B. The "Feed" (UI/UX Focus)Timeline View: Expenses displayed as a sleek, vertical feed (similar to social media) rather than a rigid table.Dynamic Cards: Each expense card should have a subtle gradient or brand-colored icon based on the category.C. Smart CategorizationAutomatic logic that learns. If "Shell" is tagged as "Transport" once, the app never asks again.D. Essential BudgetingA single "Weekly Remaining" progress bar at the top of the home screen. No complex sub-budgets for the MVP—just "How much do I have left to spend?"4. Technical Stack RecommendationsTo achieve high-level UI/UX quickly:Frontend: Flutter or React Native. Both allow for the custom, fluid animations required to "stand out."Voice-to-Text: Whisper API (OpenAI) for industry-leading accuracy in noisy environments.Intelligence: OpenAI API or Anthropic API to structure the raw text into JSON data.Backend: Supabase or Firebase for real-time syncing and easy auth.5.
